# Hierarchical Indexing System

## Overview

The Hierarchical Indexing System is an efficient, scalable approach to codebase indexing that creates a multi-level representation of code structure while enabling incremental updates through hash-based change detection.

## Core Principles

1. **Structure Preservation**: Maintain the natural structure of code (files, functions, classes) in the index
2. **Incremental Updates**: Only reindex what has changed through hash-based detection
3. **Semantic Understanding**: Capture both structure and meaning
4. **Performance Focus**: Minimize resource usage while maximizing information quality

## Architecture

The system uses a multi-level hierarchical approach:

```
Project
├── Directory (hash)
│   ├── File (hash)
│   │   ├── Class/Module (hash)
│   │   │   ├── Method/Function (hash)
│   │   │   │   └── Code Blocks (hash)
│   │   │   └── Properties/Variables (hash)
│   │   └── Functions (hash)
│   └── File (hash)
└── Directory (hash)
```

Each node in this hierarchy stores:
- Content hash
- Metadata relevant to that level
- References to parent/child nodes
- Index content for the node

## Components

### 1. Hash-based Change Detector

Efficiently identifies which parts of the codebase have changed:

- **File-level Detection**: Uses SHA256 hashes to identify changed files
- **AST Node Hashing**: Hashes significant code structures for fine-grained detection
- **Propagation System**: Tracks which changes require cascading updates

### 2. AST Parser

Extracts structured information from source code:

- Uses Tree-sitter to generate Abstract Syntax Trees
- Maps code into hierarchical structures
- Identifies semantic boundaries for chunking
- Extracts symbols, relationships, and context

### 3. Index Generator

Creates the multi-level index:

- **Symbol Index**: Functions, classes, variables, types
- **Content Index**: Structured content chunks with context
- **Relationship Index**: Links between code elements
- **Metadata Index**: Documentation, types, signatures

### 4. Query System

Provides efficient access to indexed information:

- Structure-aware retrieval
- Context-preserving search
- Relationship traversal
- Hybrid retrieval combining structure and semantics

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Implement hash-based tracking system
2. Set up Tree-sitter integration
3. Create hierarchical storage structure
4. Develop minimal AST parsing

### Phase 2: Semantic Enhancement

1. Add symbol extraction
2. Implement relationship mapping
3. Develop content chunking
4. Create metadata extraction

### Phase 3: Query and Retrieval

1. Implement structure-aware queries
2. Add relevance ranking
3. Create context-aware retrieval
4. Build relationship traversal

### Phase 4: Integration

1. Connect with Codebase Steward
2. Integrate with RAG system
3. Add continuous update capability
4. Implement monitoring and diagnostics

## Performance Targets

- **Initial Indexing**: 10-20x faster than LLM-directed approach
- **Incremental Updates**: <5 seconds for typical code changes
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for most projects
- **Query Response**: <50ms for common retrieval operations

## Integration with Existing System

The hierarchical indexing system will:
1. Replace the LLM-directed approach as the primary indexing strategy
2. Provide a superset of the information previously available
3. Maintain compatible interfaces for the Codebase Steward
4. Enable more efficient agent operations through better context

## Development Roadmap
