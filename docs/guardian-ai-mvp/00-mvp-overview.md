# GuardianAI MVP - Implementation Overview

**Document Purpose**: Master implementation guide tailored for Claude's development workflow
**Target**: Minimal viable AI coding tool that Claude can use to improve itself
**Strategy**: Bootstrap approach - build minimal tool, then use it to enhance itself

## Core MVP Philosophy

This MVP exists to solve ONE fundamental problem: **Give Claude the context it needs to write integrated, consistent code**.

Everything else is secondary. We're not building the full GuardianAI vision yet - we're building the minimum tool that lets Claude work effectively on codebases.

## MVP Success Criteria

✅ **Primary Goal**: Claude can use the tool to work on the tool's own codebase
✅ **Secondary Goal**: Claude maintains architectural consistency across sessions
✅ **Tertiary Goal**: Claude writes code that integrates properly with existing patterns

## What We're Building (Minimal Set)

### 1. Core Indexing Engine
- **Purpose**: Understand file structure and basic relationships
- **Scope**: Files, imports, exports, basic AST parsing
- **NOT included**: Complex semantic analysis, concept extraction

### 2. Context Compiler
- **Purpose**: Gather relevant files and context for a specific task
- **Scope**: Find related files, extract relevant code sections
- **NOT included**: Advanced relevance scoring, ML-based similarity

### 3. Pattern Recognition (Basic)
- **Purpose**: Identify recurring code patterns in the codebase
- **Scope**: Naming conventions, file structure patterns, basic code patterns
- **NOT included**: Complex architectural pattern detection

### 4. Implementation Brief Generator
- **Purpose**: Create structured guidance for Claude
- **Scope**: Basic context + relevant files + patterns to follow
- **NOT included**: Advanced conflict resolution, complex architectural guidance

### 5. Simple TUI Interface
- **Purpose**: Allow Claude to interact with the system
- **Scope**: Basic commands, file browsing, context viewing
- **NOT included**: Complex visualizations, advanced UI features

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Files 01-03)
- Project structure and basic architecture
- Core indexing engine
- Simple file and dependency tracking

### Phase 2: Context System (Files 04-06)
- Context compilation and retrieval
- Basic pattern recognition
- Implementation brief generation

### Phase 3: Interface Layer (Files 07-09)
- TUI interface with Ink
- Command system
- Claude interaction protocols

### Phase 4: Self-Hosting (Files 10-11)
- Use the tool to improve itself
- Iterative enhancement based on usage
- Documentation of lessons learned

## Key Design Principles for Claude

1. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Always make relationships and patterns explicit
2. **Layered Information**: Present context in digestible layers
3. **Example-Driven**: Show patterns through concrete examples
4. **Task-Focused**: Organize information around specific implementation tasks
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

```

## Development Workflow

Once we scaffold the project:

1. **Read all documentation** (this folder) to understand the complete vision
2. **Start with Phase 1** - build the core foundation
3. **Test each component** as we build it
4. **Move to Phase 2** once foundation is solid
5. **Continue iteratively** until we reach self-hosting capability

## Success Metrics

We'll know the MVP is working when:
- Claude can ask the tool "What files are related to X?"
- Claude can request "Show me the patterns for implementing Y"
- Claude can generate code that follows existing patterns
- Claude can use the tool to improve the tool itself

## Why This Approach Will Work

1. **Focused Scope**: We're solving ONE core problem, not everything
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Claude uses the tool as it's being built
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Each usage session improves the tool
4. **Real-World Testing**: No theoretical requirements - only actual usage needs
5. **Natural Evolution**: Tool grows organically based on real pain points

**Next Steps**: 
1. Review architecture decisions (01-architecture-decisions.md)
2. Understand technical specifications (02-technical-specifications.md)
3. Follow implementation phases (03-implementation-phases.md)
